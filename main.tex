\section{Introduction and Background}
\indent Lead has been known as a type of toxitien and there is not known safe amount of lead: even small amount of lead could lead to health issues, such as decreased IQ in childrean, high blood pressure, cardiovascular problems and kidney damage. \cite{world_health_organization_lead_2023} Althogh leaded gasoline has been banned to use in on-road vechiels in the world, it is still used in many piston-engine powered small general avation aircrafts as 100LL (100 Low Lead), which has a lead concertration of about 0.56g/L. 
\cite{noauthor_safety_2021} Pervious study has shown that childrean near general avation airports has elevated blood lead level (BLL). \cite{miranda_geospatial_2011} \cite{zahran_leaded_2023} \cite{mills_lead_2022} \cite{zahran_effect_2017} Additionally, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has very recently issued a determination that lead emission from position engine aircrafts cause or contribute to air polution, giving reasonable anticipation that it may endanger public health and welfare.  \cite{us_epa_epa_2023}

Kelowna International Airport (CYLW) serves both commercial and general avation airplanes. Although its location is remote from Kelowna downtown, the end of its runway is only about 1km to the University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus (UBCO), which is a growing educational and research institution with many students and staffs. This raise the concern about possible lead contamination around the campus and it is a public health concern.
